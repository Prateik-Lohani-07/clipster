# Iteration

Features that must be added on a priority basis are:

1. [:heavy_check_mark:] Color coding- from a select few colors only- in order to allow contrasting font colors
2. [:heavy_check_mark:] Clip reordering
3. Side panel view

## Future scope of Clipster

1. Accessbility: Make sure keyboard strokes, aria labels and screen readers can use it easily.
2. Security: Can add password based encryption to store any sensitive info like addresses. Do not move towards password security, this is purely a clipboard app.
3. [:heavy_check_mark:] Move towards typescript: Type safety is nice.
4. Search: Basic text search, nothing too fancy. MAYBE fuzzy search. Maybe.
5. General UI improvements
6. Text expansion with shortcuts
